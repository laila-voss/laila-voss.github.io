Recently, we asked Prolific participants to rate some occupations on the characteristics that you will consider today. Each of their answers was given on a 0-100 scale. Here are the average ratings for each characteristic and occupation.

```{r lib, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(DT) # for viewing data tables
library(tidyverse) # for data cleaning and manipulation
library(dataverse)
library(data.table)
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r import, echo=FALSE}
data = read_dta("/Users/laila/Github/Occupational-Prestige/data/Ratings/Prepped Data/Avg Ratings for All Occ, with average and shares.dta")
ratings <- as.data.frame(data)
opratings <- ratings %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2) %>%
  mutate(
    share = paste0(share, "%"),
    share_female = paste0(share_female, "%")
  )
```

```{r clean, echo=FALSE}
colnames(opratings) <- gsub(".", " ", colnames(opratings), fixed=TRUE)

opratings_db = opratings[,c("jobtitle", "Prestige", "Financial_Compensation", "Decision_Making_Power", "Difficulty_To_Get", "Interestingness", "Positive_Social_Impact", "Avg_Index", "share", "share_female")] %>%
  DT::datatable( # put into interactive HTML table
    colnames = c("Job Title", "Prestige", "Financial Compensation", "Decision Making Power", "Difficulty to Get", "Interestingness", "Positive Social Impact", "Avg. Across Characteristics", "% of Labor Force", "% Female"), #colnames
    options = list(
      lengthMenu = list(c(10, 50, -1), c('10', '50', 'All')),
        pageLength = 10
    ),
    filter = "top", # can filter
    rownames = F # don't need rownames
  )
